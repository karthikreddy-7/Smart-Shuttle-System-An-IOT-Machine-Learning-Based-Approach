# Smart-Shuttle-System-with-Advanced-data-analytics

The Smart Shuttle System enables faster ticket payment and easier travel for the user. The primary key to this system is the RFID tag that each client and student carries. Without a PIN, this RFID tag functions as a debit card that may be used immediately.With the use of an authorization pin, more improvements can be made to enable the client or student verify the validity of the RFID tag. This Real Time Project makes it simpler and more convenient for customers and students to travel.
